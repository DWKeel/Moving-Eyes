# Moving-Eyes

Description: The Moving Eye excerise brought together the creation of the DOM (Document Object Model) and interacting with it by writing Javascript code. First we created the eye and eyeball using CSS styling. After the eyes were created, we wrote code to have the eyeballs follow the mouse across the screen within the window. This was a good example of how all 3 languages braid together to form an interactive webpage.

Future Improvements: I thought of being able to have to eyes go cross eyed when the mouse is centered betwen them. Little more tiral and error and I could have it done.
